## üö® Fix Firebase Permission Errors

The "Missing or insufficient permissions" errors are happening because your Firestore security rules aren't properly configured. Here's how to fix them:

### Step 1: Deploy Security Rules

1. **Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)**
2. **Select your project**
3. **Navigate to Firestore Database ‚Üí Rules**
4. **Copy the entire content from `firestore.rules` file in your project**
5. **Paste it into the Firebase Console rules editor**
6. **Click "Publish"**

7. **Navigate to Storage ‚Üí Rules**
8. **Copy the entire content from `storage.rules` file in your project**
9. **Paste it into the Firebase Console rules editor**
10. **Click "Publish"**

### Step 2: Verify Environment Configuration

Run this command to check your setup:
```bash
npm run check-firebase
```

If you get errors, create a `.env.local` file in your project root with your Firebase configuration:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_actual_api_key
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_project.firebaseapp.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_project.appspot.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_sender_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_MEASUREMENT_ID=your_measurement_id
```

### Step 3: Restart Your Development Server

```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

## üì± React 19 Warnings

The ref warnings you're seeing are from UI libraries and don't affect functionality. They're harmless and will be fixed in future library updates. You can safely ignore them.

## üîß Quick Troubleshooting

If you still have issues:

1. **Clear browser cache and localStorage:**
   - Open Developer Tools (F12)
   - Go to Application/Storage tab
   - Clear all storage
   - Refresh page

2. **Make sure you're logged in:**
   - The app requires authentication to access most features
   - Create an account or log in first

3. **Check Admin Access:**
   - If you need admin features, manually set `isAdmin: true` in your user document in Firestore Console
